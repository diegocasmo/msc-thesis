### Blink Comparator
  - A blink comparator was a viewing device invented by physicist Carl Pulfrich used by astronomers to discover differences between two images of the night sky [1]
  - It allowed quickly switching from viewing one image to viewing the other, "blinking" back and forth between the two images of the same area of the sky during distinct times, which ultimately permitted to more easily discover objects in the night sky that changed position [1]

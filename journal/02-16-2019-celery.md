### Celery Distributed Task Queue
  - Celery is an asynchronous task queue based on distributed message passing [1]
  - It supports real-time operation as well as scheduling [1]
  - A task queue contains messages that represent a unit of work. These messages are distributed by a broker to different processes (called workers) that asynchronously do the work each task describes [2]
  - Tasks queues provide message-passing concurrency (at the process level), as opposed to shared-memory concurrency (at the thread level) [2]
  - Pass simple variable types to the tasks functions (must be serializable) [3]
  - Make sure tasks are idempotent so that jobs are executed only once in case of retries [3]
  - Use 'late acknowledgment' for idempotent tasks to protect them against incomplete execution [3]

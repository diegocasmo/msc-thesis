\section*{Acknowledgments} \label{sect:acknowledgments}

I want to genuinely express my gratitude with my supervisor Kristiaan Pelckmans, who was the one who initially introduced me to the \vasco project and motivated me to contribute on it. Kristiaan created the \mlblink algorithm, and the work presented in this thesis would not have been possible without his support and constant guidance. I also express my warm thanks to my reviewer Mikael Laaksoharju for providing timely feedback, and a vision for the overall \mlblink software ecosystem. \newline

Most importantly, I am grateful with my family, and especially my wife Yassibel Duque, for their constant support and encouragement throughout the past two years that conclude with this project.

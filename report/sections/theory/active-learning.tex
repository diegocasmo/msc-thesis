\section{Active Learning} \label{sect:theory:active-learning}

Active learning is a paradigm in which a system attempts to learn the label of an observation by ``asking'' a query to a possibly expert user of an unlabeled observation \cite{report:active-learning}. By doing this, the model aims to learn the relationship among the observations and their labels using as few observations as possible. Active learning seeks to overcome the labelling bottleneck, specially when there is a large amount of unlabeled data or when obtaining such labels is expensive.

% What is online learning?
Many common machine learning algorithms work by using batch learning; a paradigm where the entire training dataset is used to learn to recommend or predict an item \cite{article:batch-learning}. In some occasions, doing so is in--feasible due to the size of the dataset, or because the model might need to actively adjust to new patterns in the data or user behavior; an scenario which is quite common in the field of recommender systems. In an online learning setting, data becomes available as a continuous stream, and the model uses these observations to update the current best recommendation or prediction at each time step \cite{article:online-learning}.

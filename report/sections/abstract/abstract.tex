    The ``Vanishing and Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations'' (\vasco) initiative aims at finding inexplicable effects among all-sky surveys. The \vasco project is a collaboration between astronomers and information technology researchers, and incorporates explicitly a component of citizen science. In an effort to efficiently mine the historical sky survey observations, an implementation of the ML-Blink algorithm -- a machine learning algorithm which uses a data-driven approach to attempt to learn what features characterize interesting candidates -- is proposed and evaluated as means to recommend interesting candidates from the historical sky survey observations. The proposed ML-Blink algorithm implementation consistently achieves an area under the curve in the 0.70 range and finds 2--4 artificial anomalies out of 7 in a dataset consisting 5005 observations from the \usno and \panstarrs datasets. \newline

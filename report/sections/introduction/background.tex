\section{Background and Motivation} \label{sect:intro:background}

% What is VASCO?
% Why is such problem important to study?
The ``Vanishing and Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations'' (\vasco) initiative aims at finding inexplicable effects among all-sky surveys. The \vasco project is a collaboration between astronomers and information technology researchers, and incorporates explicitly a component of citizen science. The study of differences among all-sky surveys could lead to interesting scientific findings, like new astrophysical phenomena or interesting targets for follow-up by the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (\seti) observations.

% What is the problem?
The enormous scale of existing sky surveys motivates the development of new and efficient computational tools, with an exciting role given to machine learning (\ml) due to its capacity to deal with data-intensive processes.

% What is the goal?
The precise objective of this project is to implement and test an \ml algorithm which uses a data-driven approach to attempt to learn what features describe interesting candidates from the historical sky survey observations. The \ml component is described as \mlblink and it is based on methods of active and online semi-supervised learning. \mlblink is named after the blink comparator; a 19th century viewing device invented by physicist Carl Pulfrich used by astronomers to discover differences between two images of the night sky.

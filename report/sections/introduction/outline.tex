\section{Outline of Thesis} \label{sect:intro:outline}

The next chapter explains the \mlblink algorithm from a theoretical point of view, along with topics which are required for the understanding of it. Chapter \ref{ch:meth} discusses the methodology used to implement the \mlblink algorithm and how it will be evaluated. Next, chapter \ref{ch:case-study} introduces the \mlblink case study, where the \mlblink algorithm will be used to aid astronomers in finding interesting observations for further analysis. In this chapter, the implementation of the user interface as well as the service to process and persist data are explained in detail. The evaluation results of the \mlblink algorithm are discussed in chapter \ref{ch:case-study} too. Chapter \ref{ch:discussion} presents a general discussion of \mlblink and its ecosystem, in addition to suggestions for future work. Finally, chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} is devoted to the conclusions of this work.

\section{Introduction} \label{sect:case-study:intro}

This section describes the overall idea of the case study, how it was used to examine the \mlblink algorithm, and the datasets that were used to conduct it.

\subsection{User Interface} \label{subsect:case-study:intro:ui}
% Introduction to Case Study
The case study consists of a user interface (UI) that allows users to match two images of the same location in the night sky from distinct datasets, and an Application Programming Interface (API) that processes data created by the UI. Figure \ref{fig:ml-blink-ui-main-screen} shows the UI where users can create a matching of two images.

  \caption{UI used to conduct the case study. Users are presented a mission where the goal is to create a matching. A matching is defined as the placing of the right side image on top of the other one, and obtaining an accuracy based on how good such matching is (i.e. how well the objects of one image align with the objects of the other image). The accuracy achieved by a matching is shown to the user in the right side of the UI.}

\subsection{Matching Accuracy} \label{subsect:case-study:intro:matching-accuracy}
The UI uses an accuracy threshold shown to the user in the right side of the screen to determine whether a matching of two images is good or not. If a user is able to achieve an accuracy greater or equal than that of the accuracy threshold, the mission is then considered to be successfully completed and the two images are unlikely to contain an anomaly. If the accuracy achieved by the user is less than that of the accuracy threshold, then the images that represent the mission are considered to be potential anomalies.  \newline

The accuracy threshold used to conduct the case study was fixed at $80$\%. To fix it, a few missions from the datasets were randomly selected and manually altered to represent anomalies of interest, such as replacing a bright section of one of the images with its background, while the other image remained unaltered. Figure \ref{fig:fake:mission-13} shows an example of an anomaly that was manually created, where the center object of the image from the \panstarrs dataset has been replaced by its background. When missions like this were presented in the UI, it was found to be difficult, and in some occasions impossible, to get an accuracy greater than $80$\%, and thus why it was selected as the accuracy threshold.  \newline

% > Image matching
% > What are the assumptions made on image matching (i.e. a good matching means no anomaly, while a bad matching means there's probably an anomaly)
% > ROI
% > Why the idea of the ROI?
% > Using image subtraction to compute accuracy (define accuracy)
% > Disadvantages: one-way, artifacts in USNO
% > Mean filter
% > Binarization
% > Finding objects with connected components
% > Replacing original objects by equal sized objects as a normalization technique

\section{Crawling Candidates} \label{sect:meth:intro}

Algorithm \ref{pscode:ml-blink} shows the basic building block of what the \mlblink algorithm does, where the time steps represent when the algorithm is called to generate a new candidate. The value $v$ of a mission defines how similar it is to what the \mlblink algorithm has learned in the matrix $\vect{D}$ (or active set). Since the \mlblink algorithm is designed to learn what non--anomalies are, retrieving the mission with the minimum value $v$ of all that were crawled represents the one that is most dissimilar to what the \mlblink algorithm knows at that particular time step.

                    Compute \texttt{mission}'s $v$ value \\
                }
                Select \texttt{mission} with $\text{min}(v)$ as \texttt{candidate} \\
                \Return \texttt{candidate}
            }

After a set of missions has been selected, computing their corresponding $v$ value is what will differ depending on how the weights in the matrix $\vect{D}$ learned by the algorithm are represented. It is also important to note that the very first time the matrix $\vect{D}$ is retrieved, all of its weights are equal to $0$ (i.e. it has not learned anything yet), and therefore any mission given to it will return a $v$ value equal to $0$. If multiple missions are tied for the minimum value $v$, the \mlblink algorithm will randomly select a mission within those in the tie as the candidate.

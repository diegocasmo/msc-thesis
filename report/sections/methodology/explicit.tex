\section{Explicit Representation} \label{sect:meth:explicit}

As shown in equation \ref{eq:v-explicit}, the explicit representation of the learned weights simply stores these weights in a matrix $\vect{D}$. The matrix $\vect{D}$ is then used to compute the value $v$ of a mission, as well as updating it to learn new information. \newline

Algorithm \ref{pscode:compute-v:explicit} shows pseudo--code which given a mission setup will return the $v$ value of such mission.

Algorithm \ref{pscode:update-d:explicit} shows how the weights of the matrix $\vect{D}$ are updated in order to learn new information.

The weights learned by the \mlblink algorithm must be persisted in order for multiple crawlers to be able to read and write from the matrix $\vect{D}$ at different time steps. Even though the explicit representation using the matrix $\vect{D}$ provides a simple way to describe what the algorithm has learned and how it can be used to learn new information, storing, retrieving, and updating such weights might represent a performance issue depending on the size of the vectors in $\vect{x}$ and $\vect{y}$.

\section{Parallelism} \label{sect:meth:parallelism}

The \mlblink algorithm also takes advantages of parallel computing in order to allow for faster processing of potential candidates. Algorithm \ref{pscode:ml-blink} is slightly modified to simply split up the potential candidates processing among the available number of processors. Each available processor computes the $v$ value for each potential candidate it was assigned to using the implicit definition from section \ref{sect:meth:implicit}. The result of each process is then ``reduced'' to correctly select the next candidate with $\text{min}(v)$. Algorithm \ref{pscode:ml-blink:parallel} shows the update pseudo--code to crawl for candidates using parallel processing.

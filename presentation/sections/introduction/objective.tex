\begin{frame}{Objective}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implement and test a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm that attempts to learn what features characterize interesting candidates
        \item ML-Blink algorithm will be used to identify anomalies that might be present in the historical sky survey observations
    \end{itemize}

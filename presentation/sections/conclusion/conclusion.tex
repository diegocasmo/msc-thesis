\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \mlblink algorithm introduced and some of its mathematical properties were intuitively explained
        \item Normalization and dimensionality reduction were defined and illustrated in terms of \mlblink
        \item Described the approach used to implement and evaluate the \mlblink algorithm
        \item Explained the software behind the case--study and its implementation
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Evaluated the \mlblink algorithm in isolation using the $\beta$--pack
        \item Overall the \mlblink algorithm finds 2--4 artificial anomalies out of 7
        \item \mlblink has a good performance in \panstarrs color--band \texttt{g}
        \item More work is needed to handle \panstarrs color--bands \texttt{r} and \texttt{z}
        \item Results when using average pooling were unstable and difficult to reproduce
    \end{itemize}
